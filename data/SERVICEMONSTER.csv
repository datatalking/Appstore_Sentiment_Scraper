0,"New updates are good. Fixed some outstanding issues that were annoying. 

Issue: since the last major update app forces google maps instead of Apple Maps. Maybe have the option to choose?

Things that would make it better:
1:  ability to change image name 
2: when looking at an order allow have a button that’s lets you schedule an appointment.
3: when looking at an account have a “new order button.
4: when editing account allow option to set account alert flag. 
5: iPad app 
6: really don’t like the pink box over stacked jobs. It’s a pain to deal with and an eyesore. SM5 used to offset the jobs. That would be cool.
7: when sending email allow the ability to load a template then change the content.",Kali-jw,"{'id': 16292956, 'body': ""Hi there, \n\nWe've released an update that should have fixed the crashing issues.

1,"I have been a Servicemonster user for 10 years.  They offer great support if needed and continue to improve the software.  It’s a great value for the money!  Between Servicemonster, Quickbooks and Ringcentral we can run our entire home service business with a laptop and smartphone.  With features like drip campaigns, fill my schedule, data tags, API you can automate a lot of processes and minimize “busy work” or admin staff.   Highly recommend!",AMF from IN,,2021-02-21 21:24:15,5,False,Couldn’t run my business without it!

3,"So many bugs on multiple devises. I keep hoping these will get fixed but it has been a year now. 

I get logged out on a regular basis. Sometimes several times a day. No face recognition either. Often it doesn't say I'm logged out it just won't open any appointment details. When I Log back in, the app won't function until it crashes or I force close the app. Then I can go back in and it will function. 

Quick add an appointment and try to add a note at the same time but the note doesn't save. You have save the appointment then open it to add a note. 

Google address lookup works sporadically. Sometimes it works but removes the house number and just saves the street. So we get to the street but don't know that actual address.",fly....n.....,,2021-07-16 20:25:20,1,False,Buggy
