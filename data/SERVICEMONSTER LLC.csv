Thanks so much."", 'modified': '2020-09-03T22:58:54Z'}","New updates are good. Fixed some outstanding issues that were annoying. 

Issue: since the last major update app forces google maps instead of Apple Maps. Maybe have the option to choose?

Things that would make it better:
1:  ability to change image name 
2: when looking at an order allow have a button that’s lets you schedule an appointment.
3: when looking at an account have a “new order button.
4: when editing account allow option to set account alert flag. 
5: iPad app 
6: really don’t like the pink box over stacked jobs. It’s a pain to deal with and an eyesore. SM5 used to offset the jobs. That would be cool.
7: when sending email allow the ability to load a template then change the content.",3,True,Kali-jw,It’s ok

They offer great support if needed and continue to improve the software.  It’s a great value for the money!  Between Servicemonster, Quickbooks and Ringcentral we can run our entire home service business with a laptop and smartphone.  With features like drip campaigns, fill my schedule, data tags, API you can automate a lot of processes and minimize “busy work” or admin staff.   Highly recommend!",5,False,AMF from IN,Couldn’t run my business without it!

Nothing more frustrating then the app you rely on not working. This isn’t a once in a while problem it’s at least once a week more often then not daily.
