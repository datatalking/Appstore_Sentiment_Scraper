However, recently this app was not working properly for me because I was unable to see the instagram icon on other accounts that I follow and have known in the past that the instagram icon was on their profile. And even after updating this app to the most current version, this problem was still not resolved. I went to the settings in the app and looked up in their report a problem section to see if there was anything I could do about this glitch, and it told me I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix any possible issues, so I did. But what it didn‚Äôt tell me is that I would lose my drafts I created. So, I basically lost all my videos I was making progress on and editing because of an issue I did not cause myself. Totally unfair! I created those drafts for a reason and logging out or reinstalling the app shouldn‚Äôt just get rid of the videos I created and saved to my drafts on my account! Nobody should have to lose what may be minutes or hours spent on creating content for their followers all because they temporarily logged out, ridiculous. At least I‚Äôm able to see the instagram icon now, but at what cost...Tiktok, fix this.",5,"Great app, but beware of losing your drafts",
1,False,2021-07-28 20:31:11,ogleefli,"This app is amazing! It is a great way to cure boredom, though it is hard to stop scrolling. I love how there are settings to make sure children see appropriate content, but can still enjoy the app. There is only one thing I would like to be added that I have wanted multiple times. Let me explain. When you make a TikTok you can sort it into what I call ‚Äúfolders‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know what they are actually called). People can see that the video is in a folder, and can open the folder to see more videos that are in the same category as that one. If you already have the app you should know what I‚Äôm talking about. Anyways, I have found myself wishing, multiple times, that you could follow a folder to see the content you saw and liked in the folder, and not have to follow the account. I think this would be great because sometimes you want to see certain content from a person but they don‚Äôt always post only that content. For example, if I find a person that makes videos doing pranks I like and I want to see more of those pranks, it would be nice to be able to follow a folder where they do only pranks instead of having to follow the account, since then you would be seeing more than just their pranks. I‚Äôm sorry if any of that was confusing. I tried my best to say what I was thinking. I think this feature would be nice so people could see more of the content they like. Otherwise this is an amazing app I am glad to have. Thank you for taking the time to read this!",4,Review,
2,False,2021-07-26 16:34:50,Rachelnicole97,"I got Tiktok during the pandemic last year. I loved everything about it and how it brought a lot of people together and the fun dance challenges you could do. My only issue is I found a lot of my videos on this foreign website called urlebird. I was shocked to see my videos along with millions of others that got their videos stolen. It really broke my heart to see kids under the age of 13 and their videos were on this website. The way it works is you go to the search button on the front page and look for users on the site and see their videos. I was able to get them to take my videos down but it was already to late. My videos had been shared everywhere as it shows how many times your videos are downloaded, comments and etc. later that same week my Instagram got hacked. I had millions of porn accounts on my Instagram and I couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop it. I had to get rid of my Instagram and start over. Again I got hacked. The same stuff. I just want to warn others of this issue because this website still exist and has caused many people like myself to get hacked because of this site stealing innocent peoples videos. There is a petition to get the site taken down and I encourage everyone to sign it. 1 way you can do to possibly stop your videos from getting on this disgusting website is to make your account private. I hope this helps and safes a lot of people from this website stealing videos and hacking their accounts. God bless everyone üíó",3,Great app but beware,
3,False,2021-05-27 16:33:02,breannalll,"I like this app, but there's a couple of things I wish could be fixed and added to it. Firstly, I used to be able to just swipe my screen to switch to the for you page and following, but I can't anymore. It was a convenient feature and I miss it. Secondly, I love the favorites feature. I like to put videos in there to watch later. But I have way too many of them and all of the videos relate to different things, so when I want to find a specific video in my favorites it can get irritating. I wish there was a way to organize them better, maybe like making playlist sort of things. It'd be much easier to look for them. Thirdly, I hear creators talk about how some of the filters dramatically changes their face. I saw that even just recording a video without a filter does that. Like for example, it makes your face look a lot slimmer and tints your lips or changes your eye color without even using a filter. It can also smoothen your skin or make you lighter. Some of the creators can't even turn this off. I think this is an issue because 1, you can't turn these filters off. 2, it can make people feel worse about themselves. It tries to ""fix"" things that are completely normal about your appearance when none of it needs to be fixed. It can make people feel more insecure about themselves. Other than all of that, I like using Tiktok. There's just some things I don't like about it.",3,Some complaints and suggestions,
4,False,2021-06-30 06:55:45,c'mon y'all.,"I absolutely love tiktok and the platform is gives to people, but it needs more regulation. There‚Äôs too many children on this app when it‚Äôs 12+ and they‚Äôre being raised by influencers who post raunchy videos. Also, there are constant reposts of videos of death, self harm, and child nudity. I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but I would not like to open my app to become a sex offender or traumatized. Another thing is the filters; I understand that people use them to feel better by using some face changing stuff, but there should always be an option where you can tap to only have the effects without added makeup. There‚Äôs one filter that‚Äôs been a trend where someone can morph their face from an old picture, but it puts makeup on the live one?? Are you guys trying to market a generation of people even more insecure than everything else they‚Äôre vulnerable to? I understand that running an app with an abundance of users is difficult, but i don‚Äôt understand how a video with a cuss word gets banned before a video with genuinely illegal content does. And as a whole, the filters being put out are much easier to regulate than user content. These are issues constantly being brought up on the platform and I‚Äôm simply voicing it in the reviews section but please do better for the youth and young adults alike. This is an influential app for the new generation, and it needs more effort put forth for its users. More empathy.",3,New Age Social Media,
5,False,2021-06-21 23:34:58,Zanna .,"For all of the hype that surrounds TikTok, it is an incredibly interesting app that plays a major role in the life of most adolescents today. It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‚Äòside‚Äô of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.",3,Social Work student here!,

There are so many great people on this app and so many that basically are role models for the communities and are people to look up to. On the other hand, I feel that there isn‚Äôt nearly enough enforcement against cyber bullying. Especially with anti-trans people. I‚Äôve seen so many death threats, so many awful comments to give people dysphoria, and just downright trying to belittle anyone that is openly a part of either of these communities. And over half the time these comments are never taken down from reports and there‚Äôs no action against these people‚Äôs accounts where their main goal is just to harass both people of the lgtbq+ community or people showing their creativity through cosplay, fursuits, anime, anything revolving around that. This app is meant to just have fun and create a sense of community yet this issue has continued to ruin our experience. If anything this issue has worsened over the years and have caused so many people to stop doing what they love. It has made it much more harder than it already is for people to come out openly about their sexuality. As there is a great community on this app, I just wish that this issue is taken more seriously as it has a very large impact on a lot of people.",3,"Great Cosplay & LGBTQ+ communities, but awful cyber bullying",

My tiktok experience has been the best! I‚Äôve gotten no hate but it is still possible! So be aware, however it is a really fun app to make videos, react to videos, and find your favorite creators to follow! There are live streams that you get alerted when someone your following goes online. There is also a following page where you can scroll through videos of only the people you follow! There is also a for you page that allows you to fine new creators and great content! Time passes by QUICK with this app so be careful! Remember to stay healthy while on this app! You can also search for certain accounts to follow, certain hashtags, videos, users, sounds, and other things in the search bar! It is a super great and fun app that can also be educational, I seriously recommend getting it! 4/5 star rating! 

I have one recommendation for an update! Maybe adding a certain option to only update videos to a certain gender of viewers could be helpful! Like for example, videos about women puberty tips could be a helpful reason to make it only for women. Adding a video about this on a man/boy‚Äôs for you page is not exactly appealing to them. This can also be vice versa. Just a small recommendation for the viewers possible safety and entertainment!",5,It‚Äôs amazing! But needs some updates,

Getting on this app everyday and seeing my favorite creator will always make my day. Even when I myself started making content and gained over 400k followers, the love I was getting everyday helped me through a lot of problems that I was facing. I have no idea what is going on. My friends and their friends are getting temporarily banned from posting and some of them have even gotten banned. TikTok has taken down videos that I have had up for a long time, then take it down for a reason that has nothing to do with the video. I make the same content that I have been making since March of 2020 why are my videos just now are being taken down it is very stressful. I have also deleted every video on my TikTok that I feel will violate their community guidelines so that my chances of getting banned are low. I just hope that TikTok sees this review and do something about it because it must have got to be a system problem because it has never done this before. I can see if I posted very inappropriate content then the videos I post get taken down but I post the same content that I have always been posting. So TikTok just please do something about this because it is so draining to the people who is actually committed to the app. Thank You- dedicatedcobie (<TikTok)",3,People are getting banned for no reason‚Ä¶..,

10,False,2021-01-12 19:21:28,Lexi Hale,"Honestly I like this platform a lot. If it weren't for a few things I would give it 5 stars... firstly, it's the newest of the popular social media platforms in America. It's a lot easier to get likes, follows, and views due to there not being as many creators. Because of this, going viral isn't as hard and it's a great tool for a lot of aspiring artists, musicians, comedians, and content creators which is why I love it so much. Also a great resource for people who need help or want to make extra money. However, I do not like the fact that TikTok chooses to shadow ban creators they don't personally agree with (it even made me unfollow some creators without me ever pressing the ""unfollow"" button and did not notify me at all), yet they let actual offensive content stay up (jokes/videos about rape/sexual assault, racism, misogyny, homophobia, etc). It's biased and unjust, I feel guilt sometimes for supporting this app. I might not be able to use it any longer if this continues. Also, you should be able to comment many more characters, it's limiting our ability to speak up for what's right. It's also very frustrating & annoying. Lastly, you really should be paying you're creators a lot more. Especially since you make so much on ads. They deserve a bigger cut of the money for the hard work they put in. I really do love Tiktok and I want to keep using it so please fix these issues... thanks.",3,Entertaining but Corrupt,
11,False,2020-12-29 03:58:34,Suazo Sofia,"Okay, here‚Äôs my review. This APP IS WONDERFUL. But there are some down sides to it. So, I deleted this app once but I wanted it back so I can use it on my spare time. So I just got it back and apparently I can‚Äôt get back into my old account. I saved all the data but the password doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve tried a bunch of times. It‚Äôs probably a bug. Anyways, my second ‚Äúbut‚Äù is that even if you don‚Äôt want an account and your trust trying out the app, don‚Äôt pull up the pop-up that says ‚ÄúSIGN UP‚Äù or ‚ÄúLOGIN IN‚Äù. I honestly don‚Äôt want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext. At this time-period, you don‚Äôt have anywhere to be, or anything to do besides hang with your roommates (roommate), family members, or yourself. Trust me, it‚Äôs tough. But at this point social-media is our life now to figure out things and to learn more. (This probably has nothing to do but I‚Äôm trying to give ideas and my opinions). Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don‚Äôt want to see the pop-up where it says to ‚ÄúSIGN IN‚Äù or to ‚ÄúLOGIN IN‚Äù. Please don‚Äôt get me wrong but this app is incredible because I use it on other devices. But this device I use daily needs this app! Thanks for letting me share my review.

I think that you should be able to report someone and they would not be able to go on with doing the same thing they did, though thankfully- more than one person has to report the user, but indeed I have an idea you could add! The person should be active on their account at least 3 days so the same person does not report them with different accounts they are making. I suggest this app for many people that should be at least 10, basically double digits due to multiple swears that are allowed on this app. Maybe more edit options like, example; Camera swinging from on direction to the original video. This app is definitely absolutely perfect for people who enjoy making videos for others to see and enjoy! Though maybe make accounts get to the for you page more since its uncommon people search up a hashtag and find your video. Though I absolutely can‚Äôt stand this app, it‚Äôs amazing!

I hardly ever get notifications for the accounts I want to stay in touch with. I suggest making push notifications more customizable as in being able to get all new video notifications from certain accounts. This would also help content creators as well because it would allow their content to be seen more. We are all struggling in this pandemic and I feel this would be a great help for smaller creators in the creator fund. Another problem is how you enforce your rules. I‚Äôve seen countless high follower count, young, fit women showing off more than what should be shown, as there are children on this app, while smaller creators are having their videos taken down with showing less than what the more popular creators are showing off. It is completely unfair and unjust. On one of the pages I follow, one of their videos was taken down for nudity, with showing an appropriate one-piece swimsuit, while there are other videos with much more shown off are still up.

You are allowed to have a private or public account depending where n your comfort. A private account means that you have to send a request to follow the user. This also means that you have to follow the user in order to watch their videos. Having a public account means anybody can follow you and anybody can sit and scroll through your account. You can remove followers. When having a public account, your videos may also be on the for you page. The for you page is videos you can scroll through of content that is recommended for you based on what you like and save. This is how many videos go viral. So an overall rating on this app, 10/10 would recommended, it keeps you busy all day and there is a video out there that will make you laugh.",5,TiktOk,

Sometimes with my bio I tried to change it and it won‚Äôt let me I even counted my letters and numbers and it wasn‚Äôt even 20 sooo..Another thing is when your scrolling through your feed it goes ‚ÄúYour typing to fast slow down and take a break‚Äù.

There is an option where you can save your videos private but they fill up your whole feed like on the old musically you could just click on your privates and they would all be together under one thing. One thing that is really making me mad tho is I can‚Äôt see how many people have seen my musically when I click on it. It only shows the number of likes but who knows if those are the exact number of likes. The only way you can see how many views is on your main profile page.

I have a LOT of social media, and they don‚Äôt even compare. There is so much you can do on tiktok, and it‚Äôs actually very easy to get famous compared to other social media‚Äôs, because everyone has equal opportunities. Aside from that, when tiktok says trends start here, I used to just roll my eyes, but now I literally see that around 80% of the trends I see are based on tiktok. Anything can go viral there in less than an hour. About age limits, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app for anyone under 12, because it does have cursing, and content that is not appropriate for younger audiences, however, if it is a parent managed account, parents are able to control what their child watches, what their child posts, they can make the account private, so that only friends can see their posts, and they can even block curse words.

Now with most other platforms there is more choice in what you watch and consume but on TikTok there‚Äôs no filter, you watch what it points in front of you. And the vast majority of the creators, or should I say people who have posted some on TikTok, have no intentions of creating a actual good video. They are there to post something and get views. More then less the videos on TikTok are just to waist your time and try to pander to their audience and not make a good or worthwhile video. With that being said this goes nothing against the TikTok platform, I think TikTok was a great idea yet the publicity of it made it a place for people to search for stardom in their own way, since the bases of the TikTok platform can promote this single video that is bad quality with no reason to exist to million of views and likes. Now also TikTok is extremely addicting to a point where it is unhealthy. It‚Äôs strategy is for you when you are bored to open up and watch 1 or 2 videos but then you go down a long route of watching hundreds of videos and you spend hours of your life. My advice. Don‚Äôt get it, and watch a different platform.

So when you go to create your first TikTok you can choose all different sounds even make your own. Make to look at the trends to on there. There‚Äôs a new challenge everyday. There‚Äôs also filters and face filters that you can choose from too. You can also look at the ‚Äúfor you page‚Äù and the following page (only people you follow are on there). And if your account is private, people can send you follow requests you can either approve the follow request or disapprove the follow requests. My account is private I only accept the people I know.

Ive made a lot of videos on my account, and Im always making videos that are fun to watch, but go along with the guidlines. However I think the report and appeal system is very bad. I recently made a video that was actually me doing a trend that is on tiktok for halloween. It's a trend where you pore candle wax in water, and it will create the first letter of the person youre gonna marry. I tell you this because its a silly harmless tiktok that everyone is doing. About 3 minutes of me posting the video, someone reported it, and it was immediatly taken down without question. I was given the option to appeal which I did because the video I made didnt go against any guidlines (which I made sure to read to see if I actually did something) about 3 more minutes go by, and I'm told the same message except now it says that my appeal was denied. I understand we need this stuff for actual offensive and dangerous content, but I feel the reporter has too much power which leaves the appealer to have almost no say in the matter whether their video was offensive or not.

Another concern is not having enough fans to go ‚Äúlive‚Äù.  
I had hopes to go live a few weeks after I started my account but I haven‚Äôt had any progression. Honestly, I think you would need just 100 followers to go live on the app. I also don‚Äôt like how TikTok puts all famous people on my ‚ÄúFor you‚Äù page, I would like to give chances to smaller accounts, such as account with at least 30 followers.

Like videos to show support. Follow to show love. Share to friends to help the creator grow. You can look at any topic you like including: music, art, wholesome, funny, memes, aviation, news, school subjects, and so much more. If you want to get away from people or the world for a little, this is the place to go. There are things strictly on this app only for kids 13+. But with the new TikTok policy, everyone is safe(including children). You can even chat privately with creators that follow you and you follow them. In order to do that you need to verify your account by giving your phone  number. You can even make multiple accounts. TikTok is safe, fun, and engaging.

TikTok is unable maintain a consistent enforcement of its community guidelines since they will refuse to take down videos that are in clear violation of community guidelines (for example acts of violence against people and animals, derogatory speech, sexual exploit, etc) or when they do try to ‚Äòenforce‚Äô guidelines, the app takes down videos that do not violate them but are falsely reported by a mass of trolls or go against the app‚Äôs ‚Äòagenda‚Äô. For the latter case, TikTok does not make an effort to work with creators who have been falsely accused and will shows little regard to have the video restored in most situations. It is quite intolerable that the app allows people to exploit its community guidelines just to harass or silence creators. Also, important social issues/injustices that people try to use their platform to call attention to have been silenced by TikTok through either limiting video‚Äôs showing in its algorithm or outright taking down the video with little explanation. Overall, I hope that TikTok is able to do something about this issue soon because for an app that is directed towards all ages, it not only puts people at risk, but displays a cruel injustice that can be simply resolved if the administrators of this app showed any sense of appreciation, decency, and care to the users and creators that make their app popular enough to yield a living and paycheck.",1,Funny and addicting but there are several issues,

The people who work on TikTok seriously need to work more on how they monitor the app. A feature to make your profile only accessible to those 13 and older would be great ( its not like the app started out as a 13+ app or anything, no way, that‚Äôs not why there are 7 year olds using it now ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ).

It‚Äôs stupid. Also, the outcasts in society dictate who stays and who goes on this app. People get banned for a having opinions or beliefs contrary to what‚Äôs popular. Also, the community guidelines are a joke because of seen one celebrity post nothing but dildos as his content on an app for people 12+ and I reported his videos and they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt break community guidelines‚Äù.

As much as I may hate the app for this, I still remain on it because of how happy it can make me sometimes. It gets hard to enjoy it when all you do is shadowban and delete my content. It‚Äôs unfair and disgusting. 
At least let us KNOW before you go ahead and block all of our content. Like, give us cosplayers a warning, and then we‚Äôll start using different tags, or calming down on our posts a little. We aren‚Äôt spamming the hashtag or making inappropriate tiktoks, we‚Äôre making our cosplays known.

Tik tok let‚Äôs groomers on this app rapers and all kinds of people.. You silence the people who‚Äôs trying to speak out and delete the videos of people spreading awareness of the causes. it‚Äôs sickening how tik tok can let people be so negative and disgusting on this app. But banned the people who stand up and speak. Tik tok is so toxic and nasty my 7 year old brother can go on there and find men jerking off on they pfp and girls twerking.. and a lot of other nasty stuff that shouldn‚Äôt be on there. .. My experience was people where attacking this one girl for being trans and I was politely explaining to them how that‚Äôs wrong.. and people went on my page and reported me.. but tik tok doesn‚Äôt look into the situation they just ban.. And I didn‚Äôt get a warning or anything my account was banned for nothing..  So if you are wanting you/your child to download this app I would be cautious of all the pornography/pedophiles on this app because tik tok lets them be on here.. how could u allow such a toxic environment?! And this app is 12+ so u allow 12+ to be attacked and harassed by grown men?! Maybe tik tok should look at they‚Äôre app and maybe look into situations instead of dismissing them !!,4,Ok but.,

There is a MASSIVE amount of hate speech, racism, homophobia, religious persecution, and other prejudice. Extremely dangerous misinformation, radical opinions expressed on such a way as to incite hate, violence, or vandalism. Self harming, serious threats being made, harassment (extremely common), dangerous advice, slander and libel, the list goes on and on...and so many of them get reported multiple times but somehow don‚Äôt violate community standards???

76,False,2019-04-02 07:26:46,PoniesAreEvil666,"Tik Tok obviously is not a platform for children to be browsing on, so I don't understand what the problem is with a little bit of adult humor. There are way too many people who get offended by little things. For example, I made a video simply following a trend of doing a certain dance aggressively. Out of nowhere, a ton of people started hating in the comments for ""being rude to the creator of the dance"" by doing it aggressively. Then in a week or two, the video was ""under review"" and still has been under review for 4 weeks now. Tik Tok rarely ever responds to reports and also shadowbans way too many good content creators. These content creators are probably the reason a lot of people still use the app, so why shadowban them? They're just helping you expand your platform to multiple types of audiences. Also, the views system must be addressed. I have over 20,000 followers and a lot of my videos maintain a very high like-to-view ratio, yet they don't receive nearly as many views as one would expect that it should get. For smaller accounts, this continues to be an issue. Less views means less exposure, which thus means less followers. Tik Tok also seems to tend to give my less successful videos way too many likes, which have a horrible like:view percentage.

Heres some things you should know before saying yes!
tiktok allows you to have a private or public account, public is when anybody on the app can see your videos, private is were everyone has to request to see the account or videos, if a child under the age of 13 asked to get the app, definitely make sure they make their acc private! How to do that is you go to your profile, press the three dots in the right corner of the screen, press privacy and tap the little switch next to the words‚Äùprivate acc‚Äù and there you go! I definitely recommend to make your child's account private, there are many adults on the app that may be a little to creepy. but over all the app is amazing for you child to learn new things and have a fun time! If you are thinking about getting the app yourself Over the age of 15 I definitely recommend it! Its a-lot of fun and you get to show your creativity by roleplays,coloring videos, edits, and really anything!!!! But tiktok is not the best place to share private information to random strangers on the app,So please stay safe while using the app!! but like i said its a great and fun app! I love it myself!

Many people post videos of them drinking and will mention in the caption that they are of legal drinking age and that they do not recommend underage drinking, yet will be penalized for it (when many other videos are not). I once posted a video that was inspired by several other videos on the app, which contained short clips of each friend of mine drinking, and then passing the drink to the next person. My video was taken down due to a violation of community guidelines, so I submit an appeal mentioning how everyone in the video was 21. It got put back up but got barely any views, so I reposted it. It got taken down immediately and they did not accept my second appeal? It does not make sense and was not fair considering they accepted my first appeal.

     First off, the lives. Only people over 1000 followers get to go live, which I think is ridiculous. Maybe you should give new users around 25-50 followers when they first start so at least they have something.  Secondly,  you need to fix your issue where people randomly get suspended by their lives for getting reported. When someone is reporting you should make it a REQUIREMENT to have evidence and if they don‚Äôt have any, their complaint is invalid.  Thirdly, the age limit. It needs to be where people only up to 20-25 should be able to sign up, minus ‚Äúthebentist‚Äù and the other cool, family friendly tik-tokers that everyone loves.  I think this because girls and boys are constantly getting verbally harassed by older people on tiktok, such as the Budday.  They are being forced to do things they don‚Äôt want to or see graphic things. Or are tricked to give personal info such as their number, email, etc. These are just a few of my complaints.

91,False,2020-08-06 23:11:50,MaddieBeeXoxo,"I love Tik Tok! Just a suggestion, if you can't do this already! Since there's the new 5 emojis on the top when you're commenting, i think it would be a great idea if you could just customize them to whatever you want! Then you could have your favorite emojis right there when you need them. Also, allowing creators to go live who have less than 1000 followers would help so much! I miss back on Musically when you could do that. Next, it would be super helpful if in the middle of filming, if you forget to put the time on 15 seconds/ 60 seconds that you can change it. as well as being able to look up filters when you're filming, and using more than one filter at a time. Another huge suggestion is if it's possible, to make it so you can comment pictures/ customizable stickers. Lastly, and I think I speak on behalf of most of Tik Tok when I say this, STOP MAKING IT SO YOU AUTOMATICALLY UNLIKE VIDEOS/COMMENTS AFTER A MONTH OR SO! It's really frustrating when you go through your favorites and discover that the older videos have been unliked. Other than that, I love this app. I spend probably 8 hours on it a day, so I would say it's one of my favorite apps. Thanks! üíóüíó",4,Tik Tok's great but I have a few suggestions,

Do they think what they are doing is attractive?? Because it isn‚Äôt. You just look dumb and honestly for you to be making sexual content for your 9 year old fans just shows how weird you are. Tiktok used to be so fun until the algorithm messed up and only giving white racist people clout. I‚Äôve been on tiktok for a long time and tbh I am so upset with what has happened to the people on this app. All you see on your for you page is 16 year old boys grinding to the camera and making sexual povs with inappropriate language. Yeah it‚Äôs an app for teenagers but what‚Äôs stopping kids from being on the app. They can easily lie about their age and be able to make an account. Then there is girls just showing a little skin like maybe an off shoulder shirt and their video gets taken down. But what about the shirtless boys sexualizing the camera referring to sex at parties. Is this what tiktok us now?? Just f boys doing cringe poses to their phone. Tiktok you need to do betterüòπChile anyways Stan elite tiktok because we are so unproblematic,5,Cure for my boredom.

During this time, many people are speaking up about the injustices happening (blm) and lots of those videos get taken down when they have not violated any of the guidelines which I personally think is unfair to not only the creator but the people who are also largely invested in the blm movement.

firstly, i have about 2,800 followers. all of a sudden kids who look to be 7-10 (for SURE not the minimum age of 13!) are following me more than anyone my age (18.) i cosplay so i dont know if its because they see a cool costume or smthn and just follow, but i dont make content for children and removing child follower after child follower is really stressful! i even have 13+ in my bio :( please try to make sure there are only 13+ ppl on ur app. i understand a lot of it is also the parents fault, but maybe theres smthn u could do :/
also, shadowbanning and randomly deleted videos is a huge issue, especially now that BLM is on the rise. if tiktok really supports BLM, then why do my tiktoks on the topic get significantly less views/likes than all of my cosplay videos, even when my followers support the movement too? and i rarely use tags so i should have the same reach as always. please try to focus more on banning people who are spreading hate instead of the people who are working for positivity.

It is also very hard to gain followers because of this. The algorithm tends to really ignore creators that fall into the LGBTQ category, liberal category, cosplay category, anime category, or if you are just a poc who speaks out about the injustices in the world. TikTok algorithm will do something that is called shadow banning to creators if they aren‚Äôt ‚Äútrendy‚Äù and since it is very difficult to get on the fyp this happens to a lot of people. There are also things to talk about such as the actual bugs like when TikTok will randomly break for no reason, when you lose followers that didn‚Äôt actually unfollow you, and when you don‚Äôt get notifications when you should be.

Yes I watched it before it got taken down, and it was very funny and about the bible story. But then I will see videos of girls/boys talking about or showing inappropriate things in their videos, and they might get reported dozens of times, but Tik Tok will not take it down. Another example, a girl posted a video of black lives matter, and, you guessed it. That got taken down, too! I just think that they could try harder. But some pros about the app is you can be very creative and inspiring. You can share your talents without having to be afraid. You can sing, act, dance, draw, paint, and so much more.

First is for the people that don‚Äôt have one thousand or more followers should be able to go live! We still work very hard for our followers and Mose small Tik Tok account don‚Äôt get on the foryoupage. Next I think that all hate pages should get immediately removed. Some hate pages are not terrible but still are hurtful. But there are other hate pages that say very mean and hateful stuff that can affect other people greatly. I have reported an account countless times and so have my friends. It is still up hurting and affecting people and I just think Tik Tok should be more aware of the people that are just on the app to spread hate. And the very last thing is that more small account should get on the for you page and get more views. For example I have three account and one I get many views and likes and on the other no matter what hashtags I use or what sound I still seam to get 5 likes. I think more small accounts should get attention because most people work just as hard as every other big tik toner and still don‚Äôt get the desired likes and views. Please improve these.

Please just include the feature that when reports a comment, take the time to read it of just delete it. Another thing is the predators. Like all social media platforms, it has scary people. But could you just supervise the inactive accounts, looks at what they comment, and take peoples reports seriously? This app is really fun and def has its pro‚Äôs.

Anybody can just report a video and it gets took down for not really violating anything.

From running the dolls over with a steam roller to having the doll thrust when audio is played that says his murderer's name. This account has been reported probably hundreds of times by various other accounts (mine included) and yet the result is that Tik Tok every single time so far has determined that that type of content ""doesn't violate community guidelines.""

In addition to this many creators and users of the app (myself included) have noticed that white creators are routinely allowed to use the n word (content doesn't get removed when reported) while Black creators have their content removed and even their accounts suspended when they stitch this content in attempt to raise awareness and ask the white creators to stop using harmful language. BIPOC creators also get their content removed and their accounts suspended for simply talking about the discrimination they face in their every day lives.

One reason being, is that when anyone reports a video, even for no reason at all where it is not breaking community guidelines, the app does not allow it to be visible on your profile and is ‚Äúunder review‚Äù. One of mine was supposedly reported even though it did not break any community guidelines (and I read the full rules in fine print for the app) and it has been hidden from my profile to everyone for months. This happens on lives as well, if someone reports it the app automatically makes the live stop, even if it did not break any community guidelines. If someone wants to report a video, the video should be visible until deemed otherwise if it is in fact breaking any rules, then it should be deleted. Many users work hard for their content and they shouldn‚Äôt be punished for the small percentage of people who report any random content for whatever pleasure it brings them if it doesn‚Äôt break any guidelines. The app should also notify the user if their video was reported and is under review with factual evidence on why it is under review so the user can learn from it for next time, or if it is a mistake, can be resolved. And that is why I am rating it 1 star as of this time.",1,Disappointing,

It‚Äôs the only app that really promotes such a wide array of content and really tailors content to you. The only drawback I would say is the fact that sometimes it is really hard to have your content put out to other people, as the algorithm seems to be spotty in its ability to recognize content and promote it to a wider audience. This leads to many videos not reaching the amount of people you had hoped for and there is no real way to get it promoted. But this issue is not a big one, as from time to time my content seems to reach a wider audience, and so is the nature of life, you win some you loose some. This app has really benefited so many people as I can see, ranging from influencers to small businesses, and lets people reach a wide audience that many other social media apps do not.

Along with seeing a lot of accounts helping there followers. For example, A few people FaceTime followers (if both participants want to) and they have a meal together whether the reason is you don‚Äôt want to be alone or you feel weird eating without someone. also people spreading awareness about mental health and different psychological disorders. 
I‚Äôve also learned a lot about safety.

I even put disclaimers in the caption that it‚Äôs dyed water and not real, but it still gets taken down. I explained all of this in my appeal, but they denied it. I was extremely lucky to have thought of screen recording all the drafts I had taken as him, because once a video gets taken down, there‚Äôs no saving it to your camera roll. In the next update, it would be nice if we could save videos that have gotten deleted.

But slowly, as we trudged into quarantine, it began swallowing four, five and even a possible six hours of my day. It has caused me to avoid going outside, to avoid making interactions, and recently avoid doing important schoolwork, which is causing my grades to decline faster than I need them to. All I want people reading this to know is this app can be extremely addicting, so set limits for utilizing Tiktok. Make sure you don‚Äôt waste the sunlight watching other people live their dreams.

     As a rehabilitation from this app, I decided to delete it once and for all and see how much better my life is without it.

Everything you select will be on your fyp (for you page). If you want to follow people there‚Äôs also a following page, there you can see everyone you follows videos.

When you make an account you have the option to make it public or private. If you have it public ANYONE can see your vids. If you have it private people would have to request you to see your vids. You can also put your vids on friends only (people who follow you and you follow them back) or private (only visible to you). Also if you have a video you like but don‚Äôt want to post you can keep it in your drafts. 

I don‚Äôt recommend this app for kids 10 and under and here‚Äôs why. There is some inappropriate videos but you can simply click ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù and you won‚Äôt see videos like that anymore.

My younger sister had an account that was deleted recently. I know for a fact, because I keep tabs on her content, that she didn‚Äôt break the rules that you barely enforce. She‚Äôs enjoying herself and you deleted her page without telling her and for no reason. Absolutely not cool. It isn‚Äôt just her, you‚Äôve done this with other pages that have done nothing to break the rules. This needs to be changed or you‚Äôll lose the people making you money. 
Problem two,
I‚Äôve complained about this before and yet nothing has been done to change it. Shadow banning my videos. This is a shady version of censorship Tik Tok does that is irritating and disgraceful. Incase you don‚Äôt know this is happening, unlikely, I‚Äôll define it. Shadowbanning is when TikTok blocks a video on your page but doesn‚Äôt tell you it‚Äôs been blocked. So, your fans don‚Äôt see the video but you do. It‚Äôs so irritating. This should never be a form of censorship on any platform, including one with rising popularity. I‚Äôve uploaded so many harmless dancing videos and cosplay videos that have been shadowbanned for no reason. And then when I upload a video redirecting my fans to a different platform to see the videos, that video is banned as well. This is not ok. This needs to be fixed.

They could literally not let you use certain app features for accounts UNDER 13, not 16. Dumbest thing alive if you ask me.

However, I will say that it‚Äôs mostly a very funny app (depending on what ends up on your for you page) And it‚Äôs very easy to get attention for things you like doing, such as editing, drawing, singing, etc (that also sort of falls under my point that tik tok boosts the wrong type of videos, given its the videos with real talent that get around 13K likes, meanwhile a video stolen from another app gets 300k+) I think people will definitely get attached to this app, but I also feel that these points still apply.

Unlike Musically, the app explored so much more than just girls singing or dancing to a song. The app explored what other creators had to show. Including the duet feature which blew up a ton gave the opportunity for people to interact or react with the TikTok video they were dueting. I have known about TikTok even before it blew up and downloaded it when it did. I had this app ever since and the possibility of it being taken down in the United States worries me.

It was also better when we could edit our privates. Not just leave them. Bring back private messaging to people outside of friends. More people could be the option to make more friends. I noticed that most of the filters were taken away and the ones that stayed were not some of the best ones.  Bing back all the filters. It makes people be able to express their emotions better.

On top of this, there are frequent platform-wide glitches where everyone‚Äôs views seem to drop to zero as well as their followers, following, likes, etc. After these glitches people will have followers removed and sometimes the information the algorithm uses for your fyp resets so people are forced to watch videos they don‚Äôt like or care about.

The problem is the tapping to fast. It went away for a while but they added it back, even though people obviously highly dislike it. I feel like this doesn‚Äôt need to be on there, as reminders from tik tok already pop up to say to take a break, videos are much more compelling. Restricting our abilities is annoying, and makes people dislike what the app is doing, they just want to like things. Tapping too fast isn‚Äôt a thing, spam liking isn‚Äôt entirely a problem, especially when you‚Äôre liking multiple people‚Äôs content. You restricting this is disallowing many users on tik tok to have the likes they deserve, and to send out likes to show appreciation. I find this unfair and I think I speak for a pretty big group when I say I would like this removed. Other than that there aren‚Äôt many problems with the app, a couple glitches now and then easily fixed by closing and reopening the app but this is not how I would like the spend my time on the app. Thank you.",4,Upsetting rules,

And it‚Äôs wayy easier (and way faster) to get ‚Äúfamous‚Äù on the app. I currently have 156,000 followers, which only took like 2-3 months to gain! And I went viral in less than a day! Once you have 1000 followers, you can go live and therefore, people can send you gifts which then convert to money, however the only concern I have with the app, is that it is SO easy to get suspended from going live. Even if your not doing anything wrong, I think people just report you because there just haters. And then you get suspended for around a week long. I literally don‚Äôt do anything wrong, but I still get suspended... but overall, it‚Äôs an AMAZING app, super fun and funny, and they are also very safe too!

This app is a split situation for kids I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for any kids 8 or below it has some dirty jokes and curse words. If your kid is immature and still finds farts or butts funny don‚Äôt get it for them. I am actually not sure if this app is good for kids or not but TikTok clears up most of any inappropriate behavior. This app allows your kid to show their face on camera and upload the video for anyone to see. Many kids will be attracted to this app for almost every reason but if your kid cannot take hate then THIS APP IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR THEM. Many kids will see a famous person do some good joke or dance and will try to recreate it but will it  end up being cringey. Then they will be a laughing stock of TikTok and maybe even become a meme. My overall rating on this for kids is to monitor them while making their videos. You definitely do not want your kid dancing like a stripper on this app so you‚Äôll need to monitor them every now and then.,5,Is this app for kids?,

Months of watching blk/brwn communities being threatened with harm and hate and it being left up. It‚Äôs mind boggling. If censorship is necessary then censor across the board. It‚Äôs clear that the creators of this app are ok with hate and so much more if it comes from a certain color community. Secondly I have come across videos of older individuals sexualizing younger content creators. As a mother this is totally unacceptable. I have had to warn my friends with teens on this app to be extremely mindful of what is being allowed. I say allowed cause even if such content is flagged it hasn‚Äôt been removed. The TikTok community guidelines are biased. Anyone I can tell to delete this application I have told them to. It‚Äôs clear where TikTok stands on humane matters by their actions not the words that come out of their mouths or the words they type.

Overall TikTok is a great app so many things to watch, hours upon hours I spend watching TikTok I recommenced downloading. I would want to change the way people are represented because of a simple story. In late 2019 and early 2020 I saw a lot of videos saying that smaller more talented creators weren‚Äôt getting the followers\respect they deserve, as I watched more TikTok I found smaller creators that were funny, and talented and I know understand.

Most of the videos on the foryou page are celebrities, OR old videos with thousands of likes that still appear multiple times on my Foryou page. So i suggest that people who has like -100 followers should get more on the foryou page. They deserve the chance, even if they have -100 fans/followers, that doesn't mean they don't work hard on their Tiktok, they do. And maybe they are proud of them. I assure you when they film Tiktoks, they probably wish they can be like all of those influencers, go viral, be famous, but they don't get the chance to do it or at least get on the Foryou page. It's not always about Charli and the Hype House. It shouldn't be like that. One more thing, i think the number of likes on a video should get hidden but not for the creator, because when a Tiktok with like 80-90 likes get on the foryou page, the people who sees it will not like it EVEN if the content is original and they like it.

My first issue is that there is a certain algorithm to the report system, so if people who don‚Äôt like a person go through and report that person‚Äôs videos, they get taken down almost automatically. Which is unfair to the creator, when the person could have just used the ‚ÄòNot Interested‚Äô button. A suggestion on how to make this better is that you could make it so that the ‚ÄòNot Interested‚Äô button is more visible, or that when someone reports a video, the staff at TikTok have to watch it and make sure it‚Äôs ok. Another issue is that you have to have 1000 fans to go live, and that lives can easily be shadow banned for no reason, causing it to be extremely difficult to interact with their fans. An example of how to fix this would be to make the shadow-banning shorter, and have a moderator on the live at all times.  Thanks for reading!

For example, there could be sections within the Liked Videos section, including To be Shared, and a separation between recently liked videos and videos that you liked a long time ago. You should also be able to filter   through your liked videos by searching the creator, the sound, or the description/ hashtags. Finally, in addition to the For You section and the Following section, there should be a (Fill in) Genre section.

It is very difficult to make a new account and try to transfer that email. You cannot change your age at all, so if you accidentally chose the wrong year it gives a disadvantage in reach. Also, the 13-15 age rule is to protect younger peoples safety but it might danger it. Yes, the intent was clear to protect young people 13‚Äì15 but then they will lie about their age, inflicting more harm. Not to notice that the age minimum for this app is 12+. People want to go on here for two things: fun or famous. I personally like both but putting my age as 15 on their has eliminated my opportunity to have videos on the ‚Äúfor you‚Äù page and make new, safe, online friends.

It‚Äôs completely unfair to people who try hard to put out entertaining and original content. My second point is that there needs to be a better way to separate people by age, I know some kids will lie about their age but I feel there should be some sort of system to help block children from finding the explicit content that will sometimes appear on this app. Lastly, I believe this app would be more interesting and appealing if there were some cool personalisation features.

It saddens me that some Black people still use TikTok, but I know they use it as a platform to spread acceptance and to uplift the Black LGBT+ community, as well as the Black community overall. TikTok, your platform is huge. It is everywhere. Thousands of videos are shared from your platform every single day.

Genuinely funny, nice people are getting hate for no reason. It‚Äôs just horrible. Definitely not an app for people with low self esteem. Another thing that‚Äôs annoying is when you turn notifications on, you get tons of random messages from the app. It‚Äôs really annoying when your phone is constantly blowing up with messages for no reason. There is occasional inappropriate content, and a pretty fair amount of swear words. Which is unavoidable for pretty much any social media app out there, so that‚Äôs not an issue as long as you‚Äôre at least 12+.

Another big thing, please please PLEASE make collections so you can sort your favorite videos, that would be a game changer. You should also have a setting where you can block certain people from seeing your comments on certain videos, cause it can be weird when people you know see your comments.

It‚Äôs been rumored that TikTok removes content of POC while others are allowed to post with immunity or contest Under Reviews  with success. When stating reasons why a user feels like their video was removed unfairly, there is no response to them other than, it‚Äôs removed or not. There is no human factor. If it‚Äôs done by automation then what is the REAL reason? I‚Äôve had ppl do tests and it seems that if your lighting is bright, the app allows it to stay. So if you appear fair-skin, you have a better chance of being seen and the video staying up.
Several users are in underwear that happened to be White are allowed over 100K views but POC do the exact same video and will be hit with a violation strike/account ban and vice versa.

As a social site it is the very simplest of understanding that the idea is to be social. Social media is an idea that people who may have a vast set of differences can find similarities in spite of. Similarities that can bring a smile, start a trend, share an idea, invoke a thought to those we may never have the courage to meet on the street. You are not that site. You have used the ‚Äúidea‚Äù of social media to gain a name for yourselves yet you have never had the intention of being social. You stifle the voices and content of young black creators and now you have censored an entire community and those who seek to support said community. You are flawed. You are an issue. You are a misrepresentation of what social media‚Äôs intention. It is my greatest wish that every minority conducts a mass exit from your app. All that creativity shouldn‚Äôt be culture jacked at your whim.

A lot of people on the app have under 1000 followers and I just think it‚Äôs unfair for some to go live and some not to. Number two is that you have to add your phone number to send messages to people. Most people have made more than one account and once they made a new account they can‚Äôt use their phone number because it was used on their old app that they left/got kicked out of for whatever reason. Number three is there being a limit for likes, follows, and comments. By this I mean how you can‚Äôt like multiple videos if you like to fast.

I understand this app is 13+. There are definitely a lot of kids on this app, but there are also LOTS of adults. So many videos have been taken down because kids do not like videos that adults post. Most of the time, the videos aren‚Äôt even inappropriate. One that was taken down was a girl holding her dog....how is that bad enough to be taken down exactly? It seems like the ones running the app jus take down any video that‚Äôs reported without even looking at it. But I‚Äôve reported videos that ACTUALLY violate terms and they stay up. Why? .
I think a good update would be to add an 18+ update. I don‚Äôt mean make the whole app 18+, i mean to have it so that profiles can set an 18+ setting on their page so it only shows their videos to people who have put their birthday in and say they‚Äôre 18 or over. That way all ages can use the app and kids aren‚Äôt seeing anything inappropriate, and adults can post adult content (no nudity or anything, and without violating terms, obviously.

One issue I have with the app is that when something bad happens, they try to cover everything that happened. In a live, somebody has committed suicide and sat there for 30 minutes dead. All they did was cover it up acting like it did not happen. They people who created this app need to act like something actually happened. People saw what‚Äôs going on and all they do is hide everything??? Tiktok needs to be better than this. They need to control their creators too and not let this much negativity go around.

Not only are these ads super annoying, but they are also usually from sketchy and low quality brands. To make things worse, you cannot block the businesses accounts or dislike their videos and many brands turn of comments as well. This allows no tik tok users to put any input into their ad experience and leaves me feeling ignored by the app. I also think that having the comments off removes a lot of important aspects of tik tok. Discourse is one of the main functions of the app, so I think it is ridiculous that they want to silence their users to make the advertisers happy.

Tic toc is different in that it openly informs users about how they tap into data (as well as your preferences noted while on the app) to create an awesome endless array of content that is truly customizable to the user.

2: Too many glitches!! Tiktok glitches so much and i‚Äôm about to take a break (maybe) but i‚Äôm very active on tiktok and I post near 4-10 times a day and today I notices that when you try to click the black texts option it won‚Äôt click. Same for the bubble text option. Then when i click out of the text it will leave my text there and not bring it down to the middle and when I try to it doesn‚Äôt let me move it.

3: BOTS!! I used to have an old account with no posts and these bots followed me and found my comments on videos for attention. Their posts would be a thirst trap of an asian woman and they all have the same profile picture. In their bio it would be something like ‚Äúget to know me at / find me at / have a better time at‚Äù , etc and ther would be a link under the texts.

I would dearly appreciate it if my accounts were un-banned because i am not breaking any rules for my accounts. I also still have all my videos and they are not inappropriate in any ways. I have talked to my friends about it too and they as well say my videos are child friendly. I am banned and told i am too young while 5-year olds have access to TikTok.

But one thing that I honestly starting to disgust me is how people are getting hate for maybe an opinion they made in the comment section. Yes it may be rude but it‚Äôs an opinion. I saw a tik tok where this girl was looking for prom dresses and recorded a video of her showing the prom dresses. The comment section was picking a prom dress they personally liked. One girl though said ‚Äúnone tbh‚Äù. The creator of the video took it the wrong way and thought that she was saying she looked horrible in the prom dresses. The creator did ask for opinion and she gave her opinion. The girl didn‚Äôt personally like any dress. The creator then started posting videos of her and basically asking for her followers to attack the girl and make her feel bad about giving her personal opinions.

First, an individual who is being bashed on the app, if they duet or react to the video to defend themselves, their reaction is commonly taken down and not the original video where the bashing occurs. This silences select people, which is wrong. Secondly, videos that are taken down that violate community guidelines, usually the sound is not taken down with it.

For context, this post is being written two days after a white man killed 8 people ( 6 of them Asian women ) in a killing spree in Atlanta. You‚Äôd think users, especially users of color, would want to see more videos regarding the heinous hate crime that happened. Instead, so many people had their For You pages covered with videos of white creators doing irrelevant things and whatever it is they do. TikTok claims to care about minorities on their app but they‚Äôre only saying it so that they look good. They did the exact same thing by shadowbanning/removing Black creators videos last month and before that whenever they talked about racism or police brutality. Interestingly enough, the app still put #BlackLivesMatter on their app, all because they‚Äôre performative activists who don‚Äôt genuinely care about their users or the people on the app unless they look and act a certain way.

Often, the live-streams become so glitchy that the person has to restart the livestream only for the same thing to happen again.

There  are so much negativity in this app. Insults are being thrown at and men insult other men for respecting women and their talents and strength. There are grown men who are being perverts and preying on minors. There are also grown men pretending to do something sexual. There is so much bullying on this app. There is a girl who got her nudes leaked and everybody is saying that she deserved the hate. This can be the next Amanda Todd if not worse. Somebody leaked somebody‚Äôs address pretending it was theirs. After that the girl who lived there was slaughtered and put into a ditch. Then there are people who put down other races because of there race. And there are trans/homophobic people. There are people making fun of other people for their music preferences.

Although.. here are some pros and cons. Pros, there are a lot of funny people and you are able to communicate and enjoy their content. Tik tokers lately have been talking about important events like for instance, the BLM protests. So tik tok is also kinda educational. Cons, just from personal experience this has been a very very hard app to ignore, so I would be careful to ease getting distracted, for example when I do my homework I‚Äôll quickly get on for a break then that break turns into an hour break, obviously that‚Äôs my fault, but it‚Äôs super addicting so watch out! Haha, anyways another very very very very important con is the app can be very very toxic. Mean and hateful comments, cancel culture also, where mostly it is people who have said the n-word in there past or have done something racist, there‚Äôs other reasons some have gotten canceled but mostly about racism. Oh and some videos that can just be plain out disrespectful. Overall, there are some good things to this app but it definitely needs some improvement.",3,Tik tok is OK,

There are cool things and awesome dances but still. I mean the  ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù on this app are making dances that are very inappropriate. I like that you can make your account private but it‚Äôs still dangerous. 13 - 19 year olds in tight and short crop tops and shorts, teenagers online posting videos of them in bikinis. And it‚Äôs very easy to lie about your age, name, and who you are. I recommend making it 17+ or taking down the inappropriate sounds. I‚Äôm not Raging like some reviews do. I‚Äôm just saying that parents please read this and make sure your child is protected.  I think that the design is cool and the songs are fun to sing along with, but just please be more kid friendly. People can steal a 12 year olds information and find where the live. It‚Äôs just dangerous. It‚Äôs fun to learn new dances like on ‚ÄúJust Dance‚Äù but it‚Äôs not fun to have to personally witness scary content. So please be careful.

This app was originally a fun little app to make videos on but now it‚Äôs turned into a discriminatory app because if you do something that isn‚Äôt dancing and you aren‚Äôt white you won‚Äôt show up on people‚Äôs for you pages. If you make a video talking about what the US government is doing it‚Äôll be taken down. There‚Äôs an audio making fun of Down syndrome and it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt violate community guidelines‚Äù even though it does. But then when someone makes a video cosplaying a character they get Shadowbanned for ‚ÄúViolating Community Guidelines‚Äù but the videos aren‚Äôt and they don‚Äôt even say which guideline. Another huge problem on the app is that we had to devote a day to POC‚Äôs so they can get recognition. That whole day I saw 1! I was on for hours and saw one POC.

I do not stand for TikTok or it‚Äôs racist ways and I encourage you to delete the app. It‚Äôs very toxic. Many non-blacks say the n-word, people who share their story are hated on and discriminated against, people get doxxed, etc.. The minute politics were brought on this app, TikTok was done. This app is very negative and people get hated on for simple things like their body type. TikTok is negative, has negative impact on many people (mainly little girl‚Äôs who think they‚Äôre ugly).

It‚Äôs difficult to click on the small circle when you are adding videos to your favorites. Maybe in the next update you can do something similar to when you are selecting videos from your camera roll to be in a video, there will be a small circle to click in the upper right hand corner of the video when it is shown in the gallery form, but when you actually open the video itself maybe also have the button bigger so it‚Äôs easier to click. Or when you are favoriting videos, have an option that is similar to Instagram where if you hold down the ‚Äúfavorire‚Äù button, have the folders you created come up so it‚Äôs easier to organize.

The problem then gets bigger and when people talk about how it hurts them or it brings up trauma yet they don‚Äôt get seen. I find this horrible because the certain creators that make the bad content continues to make this bad content. Also there are people who are being verified even though their content is horrible. I saw someone get verified but does blackface constantly and it is hurtful to see. Also well as seeing many black creators being super creative and popular white creators stealing these ideas. When black creators talk about this issue the get shadowbanned. This makes people leave the app. You let white creators say certain things that is not okay at all (the n-word) and when people speak up about it they are silenced. Tiktok please do better.

It's a great app for creators and can be a very helpful tool for some if it weren't for the fact that in suppresses the majority of their content. It's become increasingly harder to get any views or interactions, and when people do follow you, they don't get shown any of the content these people are creating. It shadowbans people and takes down content that is usually wrongfully deemed ""inappropriate"" in some way and it's nearly impossible to submit an appeal to have it republished. I've been on this app for almost 4 years and I have a decent following but hardly any interaction because my content isn't being seen by the people who follow and isn't being put on the for you page.

I think that it is also a good idea to advocate online safety on the app so things like direct messaging can be promoted and used more appropriately. That being said, I completely understand why the restriction exists, but if you guys want to keep it I suggest maybe reducing the limit to 14 yrs instead of 16 yrs, because users that are at least 14 should be able to be responsible with direct messages. If this is an app for teenagers, all teenagers should be able to use the direct messaging. Family pairing and things of that nature should be a choice. Restrictions should not be automatic.

I do appreciate all the work that has been put into this app and there‚Äôs a reason it has five stars but that‚Äôs all I can say about it that‚Äôs good. The reporting system in this app is not functional in the slightest even when going specifically into community guidelines and reporting videos that do break the guidelines and TikTok refuses to take these videos down in the app is flooded with constant hate and near naked people. The guidelines and what people can actually do are so different from each other the community guidelines should not be considered fact. I want to add a video targeted to me personally reported and he never went down. I saw a video saying men should go to war and die airport it and somehow it said it was kicking down when I went on a different account to see if the video is still up it was even though airport had said it was deleted. This app should be a somewhat family-friendly app where people can actually enjoy the content not a near porn website flooded with politics.,2,Fun app if you fix the report system,

They take your IP, data from your SIM, your location, everything about your phone, (if you‚Äôve jailbroken it or not, what apps you have, what software, what carrier you use, etc.) your photos, your contacts, geolocation, texts, they collect information from your network and WiFi, and even if you don‚Äôt have an account, they can mine their way into another app and take your data from there, all in their privacy policy. If your Instagram account has your name, tiktok does too. your little dumb loser dances are a breeding ground or an attractant for pedophiles. Trump is banning it because it‚Äôs spying on you. It says ‚ÄúDaTa Is sTorEd iN thE US‚Äù no. It says in their policy ‚Äústored in Europe‚Äù. They‚Äôre lying about that AND that they store their data in china too. (Which is true).

TikTok has good content, easy ways to share content with friends, and the FYP algorithm is sometimes scarily accurate to link you to people with the same niche interests. I think TikTok really needs to improve its reporting functions bc there is definitely some sketch and hate speech content being allowed to exist on the app. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun even as someone who doesn't participate in trends or make videos.  

One of my biggest pet peeves is the missing function to copy or follow links from within the TikTok app. For example, if an artist I follow has a link to their store from their profile, I can open the link within TikTok BUT there is no way for me to directly open the link in Chrome/Safari or even to copy the URL to save and open elsewhere.

Second minor issue, sometimes I accidentally refresh the feed and lose track of where I am and miss out on videos, I feel the refresh could be handled differently. Finally, and this is a big one, TikTok needs to get their AI under control and start being more consistent with their banning. There are people actually threatening creators and they are not being banned, there are people who are reporting content because they don‚Äôt like it and getting creators banned, there is content being reported that TikTok states ‚Äúviolates guidelines‚Äù when it does not.

He made a video about it and said he was banned from going live and he later commented on one of his videos that he is unable to post anything.

 Although I do give the app 5 stars as far as entertainment purposes I give it -1 stars for politics. Some of my most favorite creators are getting videos banned or censored for NO REASON. Some of my favorite creators have also stopped making TikToks because of this. I feel like TikToks team should work harder at over seeing the reports and making sure that they‚Äôre valid before shadow banning or removing content that honestly is completely and utterly obvious that it‚Äôs not offensive in any way. Most creators are mindful and will announce a trigger warning before they even start their video.

I‚Äôm not one to go for the ‚Äútrendy‚Äù TikToks usually just go for comedians and cooking ones so this right here is my guilty pleasure.

In my own opinion based on the things I have seen on the app, the abuse and hate on tiktok is far worse than what you see on instagram. Tiktok will not ban those who threaten others, they do absolutely nothing about it. Instead they ban those who speak up about the abuse.

2. I (& I'm sure many other creators) favorite videos that give them ideas. It would be super helpful if we had playlists that allowed us to organize our favorites into categories. 
3. I know the FYP is based on an algorithm that shows us videos that YOU think we will enjoy, but another way to show us videos we'll enjoy as well as finding creators we have things in common with is being able to follow hashtags. 
4. Small creators should be able to go live, just because a creator isn't ""famous"" doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to connect with their followers. 
5. Expand the limitation of characters when commenting. We can't always message a creator questions or advice, especially if they're famous. The number of times I've had to reply to myself just to finish what I'm saying & it then get lost in a pool of replies of other people is rather frustrating. 
6. Add a dislike button. This will allow viewers to simply say they don't like the video without it coming across as bullying or being rude, or subjecting the viewer to other's opinions when they comment.

But when very dirty and inappropriate content, and content that break the rules, gets reported by THOUSANDS-MILLIONS of tiktokers however, they would not remove the content.

Sometimes it's frustrating especially if I can't add the sound I want because I either hit the wrong button. Sometimes I will have to turn off voiceover to add some sounds. Another voiceover suggestion would be to fix the tabs at the very bottom, your profile tab, the search tab, and the home tab which is default when you first launch the app. I would also suggest fixing the share button and labeling the options for a voiceover to speak to sharing options when sharing the video because that's also a problem.

It‚Äôs the place to go to cure boredom, watch amazing 1-min videos, or even just go on it when you have nothing else to do. Though TikTok is one of the best apps out there, it has its own flaws. There aren‚Äôt many but if I were to make one tiny adjustment, I would make it to where you can fast forward and rewind on a TikTok. Even if it were to only work on a video that‚Äôs over 15 seconds. I do realize that not having the ability to fast forward or rewind may be better for the creator, but if you‚Äôve already watched the whole video and just missed one tiny spot, it would be more convenient. Even if you couldn‚Äôt  fast forward/rewind until after you‚Äôve watched the whole video, it would be a lot better.

So I think it would be really nice for users to have the option to have provided subtitles that you can turn on and off in the users settings, which would also correspond with the users language choice. This action would be a great help with people who have hearing problems and either can‚Äôt hear what the song is saying or what the person on screen is.

People can talk about dirty things such as s*x, p**n, private areas, smoking, d**gs, etc. Viewers can spend hours scrolling which can cause loss of memory and waste time. It is also a toxic platform where children are exposed to harmful ideas and harmful people (Charli and Peaches). The privacy policy is also ‚Äúastronomical‚Äù as TikTok‚Äôs headquarters is in China and it is a Chinese company. They are allowed to view pictures, videos, messages, and personal information on your phone and save the data without you posting any of it. Also according to law in China, all the information must go to the government of China, which is pretty scary and ridiculous. Overall, I believe I should be giving it a 1.5 due to its privacy policy and effect on growing teens.

There was a video of a girl on her body were deep self-harm cuts in the video she makes an aesthetic self-harm video. Many people including me reported it. I assumed it would be taken down as it violates Tiktok rules. Instead, months later the video was still up. Keep in mind this app is rated safe enough for children. I think most people can agree on a video making self-harm ‚Äùaesthetic‚Äù is not safe for children. In conclusion reports such as self-harm or child porn should be responded to faster. 

 Tiktok is also notorious for shadow banning content of POC, LGBT, or disabled content. Which is wrong. They then say the support black live but don't many on fyp. Tiktok needs to do better.

SAFETY / PRIVACY. When I first got Musically, I thought one thing: Private. Account. Now. The programing for Musically privacy was ehh. The programing for TikTok with privacy was incredibly done. You just send requests to people you want to follow who have private accounts, and vice versa. Nobody can just look you up, and look at your posts/videos. My only doubt about TikTok is: You could look up a famous person on TikTok, and follow them, and chances are they don't have a private account. So you can look at whatever they post publicly. But overall, it's one of the best apps for children, teens, or even adults with the best privacy and safety. (Think about it as Instagram for a ""kinder"") When you put your age, it has a range. What I mean is that there is a ""For You"" area where you look at posts that might interest the age put in, so if you are say 11 years old, it will only show appropriate content.",5,PriSaf,

I first noticed this when it came to BLM, but I thought it was just the algo being weird, but then it started to suppress videos on AAPI. My final straw was when recently, I‚Äôve been seeing a number of videos concerning what‚Äôs going on in Sheikh Jarrah with the Palestinians. Any and every video I‚Äôve seen about Palestine I‚Äôve seen on this app came from either people I follow on the following tab or I have to search them up myself. Not once have I seen any on my FYP.

I am a little jelly of all the millennials who can ‚Äúwork‚Äù by obtaining sponsors to make a living making videos.  I want to be them.  He he.  This old broad would love to live free again in a tiny home on some land in my current town.  I would love to be a reality show and focus on videos and blogs and writing.  
This app lets the pieces of me, that exist from my past, resurface as reminders that deep down I am still fun and I can rise above whatever situation I am facing.
Thank you tik tok!!",5,Love this app!,

I make 5 posts about music getting 250 views. (Low numbers I know. Lol.) Then I make 1 post about my opinion on current events and I watch my next 5 videos about music get only 100 views, if I‚Äôm lucky.

They also engage in censorship and extreme content moderation, which pushes content they deem friendly and suitable to the top, at the expense of minorities and that which is critical of the company or China and the Chinese Communist Party. The owners of Tik Tok have also segregated content between mainland China and that outside China, by way of an app called Douyin, which for all intents and purposes, is tik tok. This is done for the explicit purpose of stifling dissent, and ensuring the content is absolutely, 100%, Pro-China and Pro-CCP. Regardless of your own opinions about your own personal information being stolen by a company with strong ties to the Communist Chinese government, you should all be wary of a company that, instead of allowing a platform for dissent, they actively and explicitly prohibit such speech against the murderous regime in China, allowing the citizens to be only fed the state propaganda of the communist party.

However the app is run through a proxy for the Chinese Communist Party, an authoritarian regime that has no regards for human rights or privacy whatsoever.

How can anyone expect a company based on the Chinese mainland to be independent from the CCP. Not only does TikToc propagate CCP censors, but it does so across the entire world including North America and Europe where the freedom of speech is legally protected. Not only that, but the company collects users private data. For these reasons it is implored that TikToc is no longer supported. Delete your accounts and apps.

Secondly if your not in the hypehouse or if you dont have over 50 M followers then your prob still un popular so there really is no point to the app. Third, people like charli damelio and Addison rae are treated like gods for what reason dancing, eating, and just laughing in front of the camera, while there are other people working for hours and not getting any recognition for it and maybe a couple hundred likes and thats it.

Reasons for bans are usually claims that videos or creators have ""broken community guidelines,"" all the while white, cisgender, heterosexual, christian, and often male creators can be extremely sexually suggestive to their majority preteen audience and have their videos and accounts untouched by the app. Activism on this app is constantly shut down and shadow banned as well.

Sometimes when I try and post a video, TikTok crashes in the middle of the process. It annoys me because I can never get the video out. My suggestion is; when you go to your home screen, and it asks whether you want to finish editing or quit...I believe it should have the option of saving the unfinished video to drafts.

I also think that video should be able to be longer it would help make a lot of videos. And I think that one popular filter that has the line that goes across the screen and that make you pause but the real you can do whatever should be aloud in America because a lot of people want to use it.

-the music library isn‚Äôt complete, tons of songs (not just unpopular songs or new ones but full songs that‚Äôve been engrained into pop culture) are missing

-the video editing on the app itself is a little confusing and if you mess up on one part in the beginning but then do fine on the others you‚Äôd have to delete the whole video to fix that one beginning part

-sometimes the musics off

-when downloading your own videos, it keeps the watermarks on them and your name/title on the end (which I just personally think should be an optional thing :/) 

-you it won‚Äôt play songs longer than 15 seconds (atleast for me, idk if others have this exact problem) 

-when videos get taken down they rarely have an explanation to why they did, you just get a message saying basically ‚Äúthis video was taken down because it violated the community guidelines.‚Äù But it doesn‚Äôt say which guideline the video violated and it doesn‚Äôt give you any chance to truly make it up besides typing something up saying ‚Äúcheck it out again I think you messed up‚Äù which is overall a really bad way of trying to fix this

Only to go on and see it‚Äôs got reported. And then I look back and see it was deleted. It showed a prop knife which I clarified it was a prop in the bio thing. This app is horrible to cosplayers. Not only did you make a tag which was great but you let it be infested with spoiled kids who think they are cosplaying but buying cheap costumes when really it‚Äôs super offensive to the hard work cosplayers put into their outfits. We get out post deleted because children don‚Äôt get the concept of cosplay and think because someone is wearing a cosplay that shows a little skin or has a prop weapon or gore or a little bit a blood it‚Äôs inappropriate and you guys take it down.

 However, a child can get a private account that shields them from most of this and they can tell Tik Tok when they are uncomfortable when seeing or hearing something. On the other hand there are also many kind, uplifting and positive videos on Tik Tok.  I believe that if handled appropriately, Tik Tok is a great app to have for a tween-teen kid because of the education and lessons communicated through teachers and news Chanels on this app. Not only this, but Tik Tok can also teach stress reliving technics and help with ones stress.

Videos also do not download to my phone, despite having the settings on for it to do so. This glitch needs to be fixed immediately. 

On a side note, the reporting system for Tiktok also needs work. While Tiktok has attempted to remove users under the age of 13, they still abundantly exist. They report every video they don't like, and report live streams for not getting shoutouts. When a live stream gets reported, there is no option to appeal it. When my best friend went live, her stream got suspended for a week after children under the age of 15 reported it when we refused to engage in sexual acts on the live stream for them.

I don‚Äôt even curse. I‚Äôm a straight A student and overall a good kid. In my videos there‚Äôs no cursing, showing inappropriate images and I just don‚Äôt get why they banned me. I‚Äôm really upset about it and now I can‚Äôt watch videos because it‚Äôll only make me want to make videos so I ended up deleting the app. I know multiple people who got banned for no reason and ended up deleting tik tok.

First, I think that the follower requirement to start a live should be: A) Brought from 1000 down to 100. Or B) Removed completely. It may really help smaller accounts get popular.
Second, I‚Äôd like to talk about duets. Sometimes, videos that have some type of joke that is best enjoyed duetted, it can lead to an abundance of duets together, know as a duet chain. And because videos on the right get harder to see with so many others, I think you should be able to scroll left and right when a video is duetted, knowing what the original/other videos were.
Third, regarding the notification log in the app should tell you if one of your videos got on the for you page. This is because I saw some comments on some videos saying ‚Äúfyp‚Äù (for you page) and I think that they should just be notified by the app. And on the topic of pages, it doesn‚Äôt quite make sense that if you post a new video, it pops up on your following list. It is unnecessary, and I think it should be removed from there.

Please note, these weren‚Äôt complaints, these were just new mechanics that I thought could be useful. I would‚Äôve given you a five star, but I felt that the things I talk about meant that this app has some manageable imperfections. Thank you.",4,Addictive and funny but....,

As impatient and childish as it sounds of me to say, I have had a difficult time getting on the For You Page. Because of this, my content is roughly getting 1 view per video. If I were just barely starting out on an account, this would seem natural, but I‚Äôve made about 100 videos so far, with hardly any success of any kind whatsoever.

I‚Äôve been asking around, and there‚Äôs a lot of users on TikTok who are feeling the same way. I‚Äôve viewed their profiles and‚Äî just like mine‚Äî they‚Äôre getting very little to no attention on their videos. 

Maybe getting no attention the first hundred of videos you make is normal, and maybe I‚Äôm just overreacting‚Äî but I personally think that it‚Äôs difficult to enjoy making videos on TikTok, when you know what nobody will see what you create. 

The suggestion I have is that I was wondering if you guys can create a hashtag, or a challenge or something for us small tiktokers or unnoticed tiktokers that can help us gain more attention for our content.

I understand if a video is breaking the guidelines but there are some videos that are simply spreading awareness about a topic and not breaking guidelines getting banned and their videos removed. They are also known for banning people for no reason. They will ban you without warning rather they banned you by mistake or they banned you because you were breaking community guidelines or if they banned you simply because you would be making too much money in the creator fund. But if your account got banned and you believe it was by mistake so you try and reach out to tiktok you get met with either horrible customer service or just no reply at all.

I don't want y'all to take down the app but some corrections can change even if this app is for older people thats no excuse for y'all to encourage 12 year olds to do things they shouldn't be doing. This app is cool in all but its like the rating should be at 17+ or at least 14+ I mean we cant lie here they do have grown ups doing things on this app that is something they can encourage youngsters to do.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ

Listen Closely and Follow

TODAY'S SCRIPTURE:

I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
Psalm 32:8

TODAY'S WORD:

Many times we don‚Äôt realize that God is speaking to us. We feel an impression on the inside, a prompting to be good to someone. That‚Äôs not random. That‚Äôs God talking to us. Or, maybe you‚Äôre in a situation where you feel an uneasiness. Something says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right. Stay away.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just your nerves. It‚Äôs God protecting you. Don‚Äôt ignore it, don‚Äôt talk yourself out of it; just obey. If you‚Äôll follow that still, small voice, God says He will guide you along the best path for your life. If we‚Äôre listening to His still, small voice‚Äîthe promptings, the suggestions, the alarms‚ÄîHe will save us from heartache and pain. He‚Äôll lead us into promotion and favor. Too often we feel these impressions on the inside, but we dismiss them as not making sense, or override or overanalyze them. Don‚Äôt talk yourself out of it. Just obey. Anytime you obey, a blessing will always follow.

PRAYER FOR TODAY:

‚ÄúFather, thank You for loving me and for speaking to my heart. Thank You for giving me an inner ear to know right from wrong. Help me to be sensitive to Your still, small voice and hear it with clarity, to hear any alarms, promptings, and suggestions, and to be quick to obey. In Jesus‚Äô Name, Amen.‚Äù",5,It‚Äôs awesome,

People like Tony Lopez can grab their ‚Äústuff‚Äù on camera with no repercussions. However a black creator can call out a racist, homophobe, etc. and get their account banned or deleted. I‚Äôve seen many black creators pop up on my for you page talking about Tik Tok sent them a message saying their account got banned because the creator broke too many community guidelines when the creator has never broken a guideline ever. Last thing i wanna say is that creators can try get a white racist, homophobic, sexist, etc. off the app for saying extremely offensive this that DO BREAK THE GUIDELINES but then Tik Tok will say that the racist ,homophobic, etc. creator didn‚Äôt break any guidelines when it reality they are spreading hate speech and that breaks a guideline.

The best part of the app, I would say, is not the software, but the people on the app. Like how many were back with Vine, without my favorite creators on it I would not be spending the time I currently do on this app. I, along with many others, have changed my sense of style, humor, ~politics~, taken up new interests, met new people, etc, thanks to the app. However, while it's a gr8 online community, the app developer itself has some very obvious issues. for starters, my biggest issue is their censorship. after not addressing their scandal months ago about suppressing queer, black, or bigger individuals, TikTok has continued to mute voices on current events, art, female bodies, etc. while leaving popular creators to do explicitly sexual acts in front of millions of young ppl. A smaller issue is that when you leave your following page and come back it automatically refreshes.",3,Overcensorship!!!! otherwise good,

It has never happened to me but a lot of big creator‚Äôs videos especially which is why sometimes they end up reposting it again and again. Also there are a few kids like me who are under the age of 12 so the drama can be a lot for them. This is my fault because it‚Äôs my choice but yeah... For example,  Charli and Chase, Zoe and Cody, etc. There are also a lot of weird and inappropriate content as you go but you can just scroll on them so...

I‚Äôve spent countless hours creating and laughing at their user‚Äôs videos. If you like to laugh, this app will not disappoint.

What may be a little confusing for a first time user is that a good portion of the videos you will watch by others have been created in alternate video editing apps and then uploaded to Tik Tok. Although Tik Tok does have record, edit and effects features, I find it‚Äôs somewhat limiting on the things you can achieve. So, I use it in conjunction with other apps like snap, video star, supervideo and iMovie depending on the kind of feel or effect I‚Äôm trying to achieve.

973,False,2021-08-18 20:10:41,nope-:/,"Tiktok is a great app to cure boredom and connect with friends. Although in this past year it has had a lot more toxicity. People will go out of their way to leave rude comments (mostly on teenage girls posts) and nothing is done about them. It‚Äôs difficult to have a fun experience when every comment section i open is full with hate. Another thing is I (someone who doesn‚Äôt post and is over the age of 12) have gotten my acct suspended multiple times. No clue how. It doesn‚Äôt tell me why either. This is confusing to me as there are almost nude people on this app and my acct is banned? 

Improvements that should happen:
1-you can make category‚Äôs for your favorited videos. like ex- I can favorite a cat video I see, to ‚Äúanimals‚Äù (but we create the groups) I tend to remember things I favorite (I favorite a lot of videos) from months back that I want to see and i can‚Äôt find it. category‚Äôs would help. 

2-The swipe feature from your following page to your fyp was so simple and easy. I want it to come back. 

3-Pinning multiple comments instead of one. 

4-It‚Äôs so addicting to keep scrolling but it‚Äôs more annoying when those pop up people say that we should get off. I‚Äôve blocked them but still annoying. 

5-Passwords are so hard to do. It requires so many things. I had to invent a new password completely bc it was so intricate that my pass I use on everything was ‚Äútoo simple‚Äù",4,Okay,

Other videos I have reported and have been left up include (non-educational) hate speech, anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, homophobia, copious amounts of harassment and doxing, jokes about abusing the disabled and more that I found incredibly troubling.

I‚Äôve also seen a lot of very good, educational content taken down. This was content that was talked about respectfully and in regards to social issues that need to be addressed.
I decided to sit down and read through the recently updated guidelines and was impressed by the amount of information they included, however it is already clear that those guidelines were simply released for show.

This happened one too many times and not even that, there is a current situation where a black man named George Floyd was murdered by white cops for absolutely no reason! He was unarmed! The cop had his knee on his neck which resulted into him shouting that he could not breathe! The blacklivesmatter hashtag has been a thing for the longest that brought light to situations placed among African Americans as a whole where we are being killed off one by one and yet Tik Tok banned this hashtag and even the #GeorgeFloyd! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT! THESE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HELP US VOICE OUR WORDS AND TIK TOK IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLATFORMS OUT HERE!

Why can‚Äôt there be a way to only take off your number? Second is the fact that you can only type like 20 words in a comment/caption.

 Your app is amazing but there are some downsides to it. One is the live availability. I wish that people without 1k fans get to go live. It‚Äôs unfair to some and people may like it. Two is the way it fits the screen. For my account, I use an iPad which is okay but the screen is so wide for it and it make it hard for me to control and use it sometimes. Three is the reporting. Little kids tend to report videos either if it‚Äôs inappropriate or they just do it which can be really annoying and needs to be fixed. Four is the videos getting deleted and being ‚Äúunder review‚Äù. I get it if like a video is inappropriate or gory but when it‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs appropriate, it‚Äôs either gets under review or it gets deleted and we have to repost it which tends to get annoying. Please fix these issues and consider letting people who have less than 1k fans go live, the problems with reporting, and the glitches and videos getting under reviewed or deleted.

My department training videos can get removed but a 15 year old who is barley dressed can shake her body around.
I work twice as hard as a male on this app for likes and follows, but you show skin, or generally just be an attractive female and you can have 50k followers.
Nobody understands how to get your videos viewed more, except by using trending hashtags or relevant music/audio.
Somebody can post a video of a video and get 100k likes but somebody spends an hour shooting and editing will get 500 views. I don‚Äôt blame the app for this but I think that turns a lot of people away after trying so hard.
You can‚Äôt separate you notifications which is frustrating you can over look comments, duets, or mentions. Also you can‚Äôt see duets after the fact unless you go to the persons profile who dueted you. 
You can put hours and days into your profile and get banned and lose it all. Which literally crushes people.

After 24 hours of creating a account it automatically deletes The account and doesn‚Äôt  allow me to get back in so I have to start over. Another thing is that I believe that we should have something at the beginning of the app so you can decide to put filters up for things like swearing or things that may offend people so everyone can be happy instead. Overall I think that the platform is great for a lot of people but I believe there are many ways to make it better. So next time that you update please consider what I have said and maybe even add The features To the App. Maybe the fact that my Accounts delete after 24 hours is just something to do with my accounts for whatever reason but thanks for your time if you ever read this.,3,Ugh,

Please write back and give me a very detailed paragraph or to of what I'm doing. All I do is post kid-friendly videos. I don't even have any standing out curse words in my posts. Others post outrageous videos of cursing and inappropriate footage. But I'm so innocent. I will sue Tik-Tok if this happens again.

I honestly love it so much and it is addicting however I would appreciate if you could maybe change a few things. First of all, I find it kind of weird that the app won‚Äôt let you go live unless you have 1000 followers or more. To me I liked it better when anyone could go live but yeah. Second, I don‚Äôt think there should be such a short limit on words for the comments. Instead of like 30 words or something. Maybe like 60? Same with the bio. And lastly, I don‚Äôt think you should have all these fake bots or stuff just following us. It‚Äôs probably not the apps fault for creating them or stuff but it‚Äôs really annoying.

Instead they send out general/automatic messages to help you with your problems. They will ban you without notification. They will remove sounds without notification. They will ban you without explanations. I‚Äôve made an appeal that never made it back to me. I‚Äôve emailed TikTok and they connected my email to my account and shadowbanned me for speaking up. They banned me from the Creator‚Äôs Fund without my knowledge. I made a video saying a viral dish wasn‚Äôt as good as everyone said it was and that video got taken down for ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù. I‚Äôve emailed screenshots of proof that it does not violate the guidelines and they still refused to help me understand why it was removed.

Suggestion 1: Please add a feature where you can filter the videos, like select most recent video, oldest video, and most popular video. It‚Äôll be great if you can see that feature in sounds, profiles, and more.
Suggestion 2: I know this has been said a lot, but please add a dislike button on videos and comment. That way we can show the viewers that find the video/comment contains inappropriate, uncomfortable, and/or rude content.
Suggestion 3: Please add an edit feature on comments and videos. That way we could correct things that we did wrong.
Suggestion 4: On the tiktok website, please allow people to block and favorite videos and people. That way the same experience can be shared from website to app.
Suggestion 5: Can you add like a watched history? that would be helpful for people who accidentally refreshed their page and want to see the video. It might take a lot of storage but i think it‚Äôll be awesome.

This is mainly about the website. First off, you can‚Äôt comment or like comments. This really annoys me when I‚Äôm trying to comment on one of my friend‚Äôs videos. 

Second off, you can‚Äôt view who you follow all that well. This isn‚Äôt much of a big deal but I‚Äôd rather not have to go through my following page to see who I have followed. It should let you show it by tapping following on the page where it shows your account, but it doesn‚Äôt on the website. 

Thirdly, you can‚Äôt search up accounts. When you go to search, it just shows a bunch of verified creators, trending songs, and commonly used hashtags. This makes it harder to find which type of content you would like.

Speaking of content, on the website, it doesn‚Äôt preference content to what you might like, it just shows trending videos. This ruins the purpose of a social media app, mainly because you can find stuff you like. But on the website of tiktok, it‚Äôs impossible.

Finally, it restricts a lot of what you can do. You can‚Äôt post, go live, view your inbox, view who follows you and who you follow. The website is also very laggy.",4,Difference Between Website and App,

Well, the whole concept of ‚Äú#‚Äù was to tag what concept it creates around, like, for example, a gaming video. You would put #gaming, then you can search that tag and see the video. But for Tik Tok, in this case, the For You page tag isn‚Äôt relevant unless it gets on the for you page.

This app is awesome and is very addicting. But, I have a few suggestions that could make it even better. You guys ban accounts made by 10 and 11 y.o but there are other accounts made by 7 and 8 y.o that stay on the app. Maybe you should lower the age limit a little, since a lot of 11 and 10 year olds download the app. I also think that you should be able to go live no matter how many followers you have. You can‚Äôt go live unless you have 1000 followers or more. And maybe be more careful about what videos you take down and keep up. If a smaller account makes a video that is a little inappropriate, they get banned. If a verified account makes the same video, you keep them on. You may delete the video, but the account is still there. That‚Äôs not fair. Just delete the video, and keep the account, unless the user keeps on doing it.

I made this review when musically was first transitioning to tiktok and I am so glad this app has improved and listened to suggestions.

From my viewing of this splendid app from ages   8-10 my opinion would be to tell them just to have fun, do some lip syncing and get the parents approval of what you are going to lip sync, also I recommend for that age group to be set on private and do not let people you do not know be one of your followers on Tic Tok. Anybody under the age of 8 i would not recommend them to use this particular app. 10+ I think should be fine if there not private because a 10 year old would never go viral.

Women with barley any clothes on and twerking etc..

 When I‚Äôm scrolling on the FYP (For You Page) and I see some girl with barley any clothes on, just twerking and doing other things. I hate that, then they get like 1 million or more likes on doing that. While other small Tik Tok pages try so hard but just don‚Äôt get as many likes or followers. Any parent that has a child under the age of 10 or 11 would not want their child to look at the women twerking with barley any clothes on. Yeah, you could just block/report them but that‚Äôs kind of not enough. I think the videos of women doing that, should be put under review before it gets posted.

Moderation

I think Tik Tok‚Äôs moderation system isn‚Äôt really that good. For example for what I said above this. When women are half naked and twerking etc.. those videos should be taken down or the account should be shutdown. Like I also said, videos like that should be under review before being published, by some Tik Tok moderator.

1. Some filters automatically make your face/lips/eyes/jaw/nose a different shape, when that is not the intended purpose. Similar to this issue, on TikTok lives, default setting have you go on lives with a filter on. This should not be the default! Please fix this.

2. I cannot express this enough‚Ä¶WE NEED A BOOKMARK ORGANIZATION FEATURE!!!! I am someone who greatly appreciates organization features. TikTok is my favorite app, so the fact that it barely has any is deeply disappointing. Any other social media app has a better organization feature for their ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù! I mean, come on. When you bookmark something, it goes to your bookmarks, but theres no organization feature beyond that. At that point, its nothing more than your likes folder. It drives me insane! When I want to show my family a specific tiktok, I have to scroll for ages just to have a chance at finding it. It‚Äôs ridiculous! What I suggest is that you implicate a folder system. Then, when you bookmark something, you have more of a choice of where it goes. Consumers can then bookmark their desired tiktoks into categroized folders that they make. I have so many bookmarks at this point that I‚Äôll have to dedicate a whole day just to rebookmark things into folders if you implicate this method.

TikTok will never ban the main account.  Also, people who get their accounts reported by these vile tolls have no true way to appeal and to speak with someone.  Creators have had their entire profile banned because someone was on the opposite side of an opinion and were offended.  Instead of scrolling past, they report the video.

1. I have had TikTok since it was Musically, so I‚Äôve liked a lot of videos. But the liked videos take up so much storage. Tiktok should make an option to clear all the liked videos, so I can clear my storage. 
2. When a creator makes a sound, there should be an option to lock the sound so no one can use it. People have used sounds creators make to make fun of them, this could prevent cyber bullying. 
3. There should be an option to view the duetted videos on a creators video. For example, if a creator makes a video and asks for someone to duet it, it would be nice to be able to click and see all the duets. 
4. Auto scroll button. I‚Äôd like to be able to have the option to scroll hands free, so if I am busy I can still enjoy TikTok.
5. Links in comments. With the Black Lives Matter movement, many creators give links to petitions to sign but only one can fit in the bio. It would be very convenient to be able to put links in the comments and video captions.
6. Subtitles. I think it would be very nice for deaf and hard of hearing TikTok users to have an option to see captions on videos. It would also be helpful to people with auditory processing disorders.",5,I love TikTok,

That said, there are some improvements I hope the developers will implement. The biggest peeve of mine is the in-app notifications. As of now, there is no way to adjust the settings of your in app notifications. When someone you follow goes live, you get a notification. Maybe for some this is helpful, but I find it irritating. I don‚Äôt go on TikTok for live-streams but I‚Äôm constantly being told about them. There is no way to distinguish between these notices and things like new likes, comments, or mentions. I really wish we could opt out of live notifications instead of being forced to check what it is. 

Additionally, adding captions to videos is incredibly difficult. It‚Äôs not intuitive or easy, so I usually forgo it but that‚Äôs a shame because then deaf and HOH users can‚Äôt really use my content. If this process was easier, I‚Äôm sure tons of users would be very happy.

FIRST. stop spamming people with ‚Äúdownload tiktok‚Äù ads. If I wanted to lose an overabundance of brain cells I would have already been using it. Everything I‚Äôve ever seen that comes from tiktok is either stupid, annoying, stupid (again), misinformation, fake art videos and much more. 

SECOND. there is something incredibly unsettling about allowing kids under the age of 18 to post promiscuous dance clips, which inspires other kids of various ages to do the same and think it is normal and ok. Where are the people in charge of taking down videos? My friend‚Äôs 5 year old half sister was able to make a tiktok account and it is truly depressing (AND SCARY) to hear that she tries to copy these older tiktok dancers and then post her own version.

So, first off, there‚Äôs a lot of adult content on this app. A lot. The dances are extremely sexual, and a lot of language that kids don‚Äô pay attention to that‚Äôs kind of harmful. There‚Äôs just a lot of sexual and adult content in general that kids are exposed to. I‚Äôve heard about a kid mode that keeps away things like that, but I doubt it keeps everything out. 
The chat feature caused a few issues too. I was chatting with a friends of mine when a new tab opened up, with the title ‚Äòfrom people you don‚Äôt know‚Äô. I opened it up and first thing, right up in my face, is a photo of a naked woman next to a link to a porn site. That was a fun experience.
I also kind of wish you could post stuff that‚Äôs longer than a minute, and choose where to be in the videos, because, sometimes the short length gets on my nerve, and having to watch the whole thing over again to see one single part gets on my nerves.

When tiktok began getting way more popular things changed. So many trolls are on it now. It‚Äôs very unsettling that tiktok does not have a system to be more strict when creating an account. There should be restrictions to reduce fake accounts. People create fakes to harass and bully others. There‚Äôs an account who has a baby who is adorable yet the trolls comment awful threatening stuff about the baby. That‚Äôs just 1 example out of millions. They depend on younger creators to promote their business which a 15 year old should not be the face of a social media site. Attracts the wrong the kind of crowd. I wish that the courts would have banned tiktok completely just to protect the kids and young eyes on the app. Tiktok should do better. I love the app and still continue to use it today. But I also report if I see anything awful. I wish more would too... Even Facebook makes you verify you me identify.. please create a better system.,1,Not the same.,

tiktok is problematic. they have censors that enables it easier to make a tiktok so you dont have to manually make censors, and usually the censor things pretty reasonably, like s*x. but it becomes problematic when they consciously chose to censor ‚Äúasian women‚Äù into ‚Äúa**** w****‚Äù. why??? why did they choose to censor that? they didnt censor anything else, like asian men, white men, white women, black etc., but they censored asain women. Not only that, but they unreasonably shadow ban creators and have been proven to suppress black creators and creators that are just trying to spread awareness/information. they allow innapropriate tiktoks (thirst traps) from white cishet men to be posted, but they could turn around and suddenly take down random videos from small and/or diverse creators. even with all of this, tiktok is addicting and really not good for your mental health when you start watching tiktoks at 7 pm and end up looking at the time and it‚Äôs 9 pm, or even 10 or 11, maybe even longer.

2-I would also add the option to ask if you are sure to unfollow someone. I was playing around with the app, and I unfollowed people by accident thinking that the app would ask me if ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to u follow?‚Äù I would really add that in there. 
3-I would add some form of picture sharing software, Live Photo‚Äôs for example that move and activate while you score through the feed. 
4-Remove the snapping feed and stick to a free-flow. Much better trust me.

They have great videos that everyone will love and it shows you anything to you would like! My only problem is there new update when you hold down on the video you would be able to click if you don‚Äôt like it and I have no problem with that but now it comes from the bottom and it really annoys me because I would always hold down on the screen so it would take all the stuff away so I could read things covered up by the words on the bio of the video and like the follow and like comment and share buttons. So I would really like if the would go back to the to the middle thing popping up rather than it coming from the bottom of the screen. I still love this app and you should get it!,5,Tik tok,

First off, when i follow someone new, in my following column next to the fyp, it makes me go through all of their tiktoks when i reload it. it just annoying because personally i like to reload my following to see the most recent tiktoks that've been made and when i follow someone new it gets in the way of that. Especially when i follow someone that has a lot of videos. Second, also having something to do with the following column, sometimes it‚Äôll  put tiktoks that've been made months ago by the people i follow and then i can‚Äôt see any recent tiktoks they might‚Äôve made.

As someone who is not allowed to own an account, I loved having access to being able to view accounts, search for keywords and hashtags and be able to navigate the app without needing to create an account. It allowed me to be able to watch and experience the same things that my friends were able to see without needing to own an account first.

With the new update however, the ability for users without an account to effectively browse the app has been removed. We must scroll through the FYP only, cannot search for key terms, hashtags or accounts that we like, and we can‚Äôt scroll through videos on certain sounds that we like without creating an account. We must simply scroll and hope that something we like will pop up eventually. No longer can I search for the names of accounts that I enjoy the content of and scroll through their recent videos or scroll through a certain hashtag to view particular kinds of videos that I enjoy.

I did really love the app, but the new update has made it impossible for me to enjoy it anymore and I would love for the old settings to be restored. Until then, the most I can give is two stars as I can no longer use the app without an account.",2,"It Was Great, Until..",

Mostly the latest update where it turns your private videos into drafts..... Many musers (including myself) make private videos for fun and enjoy watching you and your friends laughing and being halarious over and over. After the update you can only watch one private video at a time and it always rearranges them. And you don‚Äôt need to edit them right then and there. Most private videos people don‚Äôt want to ever upload so why would they want to be edited! I think musically should change this back to the way it was before. Also musically, stop changing little bits and pieces like what shape the heart icon is. It‚Äôs super annoying and useless!

You can even get hate through other videos comments if you are a private  account. They should remove negative people on this app. It‚Äôs truly annoying. People have to bring politics in everything and forcing religion on people. This app is no longer a safe place for people to get away from the negative world.

Just a request or a suggestion:
I would you to add a notification button or section in the app
The thing is that through a the day you get many notifications of videos uploaded by people you follow
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one that can‚Äôt check every video the moment I get the notification. So the notifications get stacked up. 
When you decide to open one of those stacked notifications two things can happen: 1- if the app isn‚Äôt already opened in the background you‚Äôll end up in the main page and the notification selected won‚Äôt show up the video 2- if the app is already opened background you‚Äôll go directly to the video stated in the notification BUT all the other notifications will disappear front the Notification Center and you won‚Äôt be able to check the newly uploaded videos that you were notified about
You may suggest me to go straight to the main page (following page) and not the for you page and you may be right but I would like to select what I want to see by choice and not go through all the people I follow in order to get to the videos that I was notified about. 
I hope that I was clear enough about it. It‚Äôs not a complaint but a suggestion/request. And if you don‚Äôt agree simply discard this whole review.

Anyone can do this at anytime and it‚Äôs not fair to creators with large followings who usually put massive time and effort into their videos 3) my feed is cluttered with people making videos about how they were banned from live or a post that did not violate guidelines was removed.

But TikTok can become very toxic. If you decide to become a fanpage be prepared to get hate, hacked, and death threats. It‚Äôs hard and your grades will start to slowy slip if you let them. But honestly TikTok has helped me become stronger as a person and I‚Äôve made the best relationships on TikTok. Unfortunately all the hate got to me and very much affected my mental health and put me in a depressed state (I was medically diagnosed with depression) and now I see a therapist every week and I‚Äôm in the middle of test to see if I have ocd and or adhd.

1471,False,2020-12-30 07:50:33,dhf do nbx,Hi. I just wanted to say is that I think TikTok is a great app but the only problem is the videos. In the beginning of the app it says to pick some categories but when choose my categories the videos don‚Äôt match my decisions. The videos on TikTok show stuff people don‚Äôt want to see. I know we can just skip them but there are some younger kids that don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre watching. When are done watching that video they can get traumatized. And you should know that little kids copy people and People on Tik Tok are some bad examples. And there is something that I just want to point out is that I just saw so many disturbing videos that had made me gag and think about so much. But if it continues to have bad videos please take them down or something because as  a child it is just to much for me.   So what I‚Äôm saying here is that it should be safer. Thank you.,4,Bad videos,

However, recently, several popular Tik Tok users were revealed to be child groomers, racists, homophobes, and straight-up bullies. Instead of banning those users or blocking their toxic content, Tik Tok has no problem PROMOTING THEIR CONTENT and giving them a thriving account. Despite THOUSANDS of people reporting them for dangerous speech and actions, the reports are basically thrown away within minutes. Anybody who tries to call them out in a video, who tries to speak out against LITERAL CHILD GROOMERS, have had their videos taken down, their accounts blocked, and their other content banned almost immediately.
I no longer look forward to using this app. I don‚Äôt feel safe on it. Many wonderful, positive creators are taking a break from the app due to the toxic content.

4. Please add a time stamp so we can rewind videos, it‚Äôs annoying when I accidentally scroll and have to watch the video all over again

There are a few things for mine and many other opinions that we think could make this app even better. The top thing is the live steam I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs far to other people they can be trying very hard to get a thousand fans like I have not all people get very famous me and most of my community think so so please look into that. Second of all I think The reporting isn‚Äôt fair I have gotten videos reported that haven‚Äôt been inappropriate or anything to be reported about the app to check it‚Äôs self so we won‚Äôt have to be worried about any profiles being deleted just like my friends was she was very sad about it so also please look into that. Thank you anyways for the app it is amazing I would just look into those things please and thank you.,4,TickTock,

As silly as making 15 second videos sounds, it‚Äôs actually really fun and a great way to build up self confidence. It‚Äôs also weirdly making my depression better. Anyone young or older can have fun with this and I hope we continue to see new effects. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the report system is whack. I understand that there are community guidelines but I did read them and several of my videos that have not violated have been removed for no reason because it was reported. There for sure needs to be a remake of the report system but other than that this app is great in all aspects. Especially if you suffer from anxiety and depression, I‚Äôve found it helps to alleviate some of it. It‚Äôs a great way to pass time and it really does help build confidence. A+ to the creator.",4,Great for so many things,

You should do an off line thing because some people can't always connect to their Internet so it should be off-line sometimes if you can't connect to Internet.  Make a new game and call it something different like something catchy.  But instead of fortnight make it videos,4,Bring musically back,
